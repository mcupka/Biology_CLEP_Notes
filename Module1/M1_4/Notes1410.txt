Glycolysis: 1st step in breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism
-Does not use oxygen
-Takes place in cytoplasm of both pro and eukaryotes
-1 glucose molecule -> 2 pyruvate molecules, 2 ATP, and 2 NADH
-1st half of glycolysis splits glucose in two, uses 2 ATP.
-2nd half of glycolysis converts each half of glucose into pyruvate, creating 4 ATP and 2 NADH
-2nd half of glycolysis needs pyruvate kinase in order to form the pyruvate. Otherwise, only two ATP will be produced. pyruvate kinase is therefor a rate-limiting factor of glycolysis

-Glucose (sugar) -> 2 pyruvate molecules, 2 ATP, and 2 NADH molecules.
	-if the cell can't catabolize the pyruvate further, it will only harvest the 2 ATP from glycolysis.

Oxidation of Pyruvate:

-pyruvate goes into the mitochondria of the cell (in eurkaryotes), where it is transformed into an acetyl group and picked up by a carrier compound called coenzyme A (CoA). Forms Acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA's main funciton is to transport this acetyl group to the next stage of the pathway in glucose catabolism.

-Movement of electrons through the electron transport chain creates a pH gradient that allows ATP synthase to pull in H+ ions into the mitochondria, using them to convert ADP to ATP.

Citric Acid Cycle:
-Acetyl CoA converted into other molecules
-A little ATP and other molecules that are used in the ETC are produced

Anaerobic Pathway:

-if there is O2, then the NADH / FADH2 high-energy electrons will be used to form ATP
-if no 02, NADH must be converted back into NAD+ for the glyolytic pathway to continue
-Fermentation: uses organic molecule to regenerate the NAD+ from the NADH
-Some use inorganic molecules instead.

Lactic Acid Fermentation:

-Pyruvic acid + NADH <-> lactic adic + NAD+ (via enzyme Lactase Dehydrogenase, LDH)

All catabolic pathways that break down things like proteins, carbs, and lipids, eventually connect to the glycolytic pathway and/or the citric acid cycle. These pathways are all very interconnected.
