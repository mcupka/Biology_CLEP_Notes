1.6.1 The Watson-Crick Model of Nucleic Acids

Nucleotides, building blocks of DNA
-Nitrogenous base, deoxyribose (5-carbon sugar), and a phosphate group
-Named depending on the nitrogenous base
-Nitrogenous base can be a purine or a pyrimidine.
-Purines: Adenine, Guanine
-Pyridamines: Cytosine, Thymine
-Nucleotides combined by covalent bonds called phosphodiester bonds. 5'-3' phosphodiester bond
-Sugar is deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA
-A <-> T and G <-> C
-3' of one strand faces the 5' of the other strand

3'  A G A C T  5'
5'  T C T G A  3'

-Sugar and phosphate group form backbone of the structure. Nitrogenous bases stacked inside

-Uracil (U) base found in RNA. A <-> U.
