1.6.7 Viruses

Are they alive?
-They have their own DNA or RNA (Some have one, some have the other)
-Can only reproduce in host cells
-no metabolism

Single virus = particle or virion (Not a cell)

Viruses are much smaller than the smallest bacteria

Viruses composed of Capsule and DNA or RNA. Some have enzymes, attachment structures, etc.

Virus
1. Invades living host cell
2. Take conrol of DNA replication, sometimes transcription and translation
3. Gets host cell to make more of itself

Some viruses program the host's immune system to stop working or attack itself (AIDS)

Virus origins pretty much a mystery, since they do not leave fossils.

Virus complexity does not correlate to the complexity of the hosts they infect. ie some more complex viruses infect very simple organisms.

All viruses have nucleic acid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins, called a capsid, made up of subunits called capsomeres.

Shapes
-Filamentous: Long, cylindrical
-Isometric: Mostly spherical
-Enveloped: Membranes surrounding the capsoids
-Head and Tail: Head shaped like isometric and tail shaped like filamentous

Many use receptor to bind to the host cell for penetration of the membrane.

Viruses contain either DNA or RNA, located in the viral core.
-DNA viruses direct host replication proteins to synthesize new copies of the viral genome and to transcribe / translate it into viral proteins
-RNA viruses contain RNA that codes for enzymes that replicate RNA into DNA, which cannot be done by the host cell

Baltimore Classification, most common classification system for viruses
-Classifies viruses based on how mRNA is synthesized during replication

Steps of Virus Infections:
1. Attachment: virus attaches to receptor site through attachment proteins in the capsid or via glycoproteins in the viral envelope
2. Penetration: Viral nucleic acid inserted into the cell
3. Uncoating: viral capsid degraded, freeing viral nucleic acids
4. Replication: Viral DNA uses host cell proteins and enzymes to make additional DNA that is transcribed and translated. RNA viruses use RNA as a tempplate for synthesis of viral genomic RNA and mRNA. viral mRNA directs the host cell to synthesize viral enzymes and capsid proteins.
5. Assembly: The host is directed to assemble new virions from teh replicated enzymes and proteins
6. Release: Virions released, either by host cell dying (apoptosis) or by budding through the membrane

Bacteriophages: viruses that infect bacteria, penetrate cell membrane to enter
Animal Viruses: infect animals, don't need to penetrate cell membrane to enter. May use receptors that mediate endocytosis to enter.
Plant Viruses: Plants have cell walls to protect their cells, for most plant viruses to be transmitted, the plant cells must be damaged

Prevention / Treatment:
-vaccines may be prepared using live, dead, or parts of the virus.
-vaccines can sometimes be used to treat active infection. They don't cure the infection but can inhibit it from spreading or being active
