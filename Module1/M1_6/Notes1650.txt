1.6.5 Structural and Regulatory Genes

Two types of proteins: Structural and Regulatory
-Structural: make up organs, cell walls, cytoskeletons, etc
-Regulatory: regulate growth, control development, start / stop transcription of certain genes, etc


Regulation of Gene Expression

-gene expression: turning on a gene to produce RNA and protein
-reduces energy needed to replicate DNA and space to unwind DNA since not all genes in the strand need unwound / transcribed
-in prokaryotes: control of gene expression mostly involves just regulating the transcription of a gene since transcription and protein formation occur simultaneously.
-in eukarytoes: expression may be regulated by regulating one or more of any of the steps in DNA replication

Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
-Genes needed for similar purposes are encoded near each other in blocks called operons.
-Operon expression is suppressed, activated, or induced.
-Repressors decrease expression, acrivators increase, inducers either increase of decrease depending on the needs of the cell
-Regulators bind near promoters of operons to regulate the expression. Upstream from the coding sequence.

Eukaryotic Gene Regulation
-Epigenetic gene regulation, regulating access to genes within the chromosome
	-Changes to histone proteins and DNA that temporarilty affect gene expression

-Transcription gene regulation since transcription and protein formation occur simultaneously.
	-Enhancers are reguions that increase or enhance transcription of a gene. binding sequences for transcription factors.
-Transcriptional repressors, can bind to promoter or enhancer regions and block transcription

-Posttranscriptional Gene Regulation, affect if an RNA molecule for a gene is processed, shuttled, or translated
	-RNA Binding Proteins can bind to regions of RNA to increase or decrease the stability of the mRNA
	-micoRNAs + RISC can rapidly destroy an RNA molecule  

-Translational and Post-Translational Gene Regulation, during or after translation
	-if eif2 if phosphorylated, no transcription can take place

-Proteins can be altered due to outside factors, resulting in parts of the DNA replication process being inhibited
	-Proteins also have a set lifecycle, after which they are moved to the proteasome for disposal. Changning this life cycle can regulate genes as well
