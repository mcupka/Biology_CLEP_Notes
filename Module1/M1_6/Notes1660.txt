1.6.6 Transformation

DNA can be changed more easily in prokaryotes than in eukaryotes becuase they don't have a nucleus.
-Transduction: a virus puts genes from one bacterium into another
-Transformation: bacteria can incorporate bits of DNA from environment into their own genes

Manipulating Genetic Material
-nucleic acids are made of nucleotides, linked by phosphodiester bonds.
-DNA / RNA must be extracted before they can be studied / manipulated
	-Cells broken up and unwanted macromolecules destroyed, DNA then precipitated using alcohol. Similar process for RNA extraction.
-Gel Electrophoresis, used to separate molecules by size.
	-Since nucleic acids are negatively charged ions, they can be mobilized by an electric field.
	-Smaller molecules move further from the well (the place where the molecules are inserted)
-Polymerase Chain Reaction, used to amplify specific regions of DNA for further analysis.
-Blotting, transfer separated DNA fragments onto a nylon membrane
-Probe, short pieces of DNA complementary to the sequence you want to find. Dyed for visibility, added after blotting to detect presence of sequence.
-Southern blotting, DNA, used to detect presence of gene. Northern blotting, RNA, used to detect the expression of a gene.

Plasmids used for DNA cloning
-recombinant DNA, plasmids with foreign DNA inserted, doesn't occur in nature
-recombinant proteins, proteins expressed from recombinant DNA

Genetic Engineering, using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism's DNA to achieve desirable traits
-If the foreign DNA is from a different species, the host is called trasngenic
-Gene therapy, used to cure disease
