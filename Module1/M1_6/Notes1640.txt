1.6.4 Control of Protein Synthesis: Transcription, Translation, Posttranscriptional Processing

Gene: segment of DNA that is a blueprint for a specific protein

Genes control the synthesis of the proteins
-2 parts: transcription and translation

Transcription: Gene copied from DNA to RNA (U instead of T)
-mRNA takes message to cytoplasm for translation

Translation:
-sets of 3 nucleotides form codons which are complimentary to sets of anticodons on tRNA
-tRNA carries amino acids from cytoplasm to ribosomes
-ribosomes match codons to anticodons
-attached amino acids are joined to form proteins


Eukaryotic Transcription:

-Eukaryotic mRNA usually monogenic, aka specify a single protein.
-Eukaryotes have 3 different types of RNA polymerase used for transcription

-RNA Polymerase I, located in nucleolus: used to make rRNAs, which are assebled into ribosomes
-RNA Polymerase II, located in nucleus: transcribes the coding from the DNA into pre-mRNAs, which need to be processed before translation.
-RNA Polymerase III, located in nucleus: used to make some rRNAs, tRNAs, and other small nuclear RNAs

Promoters: sections of DNA that initiatie the transcription process. Located near the 5' end of the DNA strand
-have TATA box which helps the DNA template to locally unwind in preparation for transcription.
-Also GGCG boxes or ATTAGCAT (octamer) boxes that increase transcription efficiency

Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be spliced out

During transcription, a complex called FACT pulls histones away from the DNA template as the polymerase moves along it. It then replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes.


RNA Processing in Eukaryotes:

mRNA Processing, needed before translation
-add stabilizing proteins to increase its half-life to several hours from mere seconds
-during transcription, 7-methlyguanosine cap added to 5' end of the growing transcript to protect from degredation and allow for translation factors in the ribosomes to recognize / initiate translation.
-poly-a tail added to end of strand, at 3' end. ~200 As, to protect further
-introns, non-expressed codons, must be spliced out from mRNA before transcription, done by splicosomes

Processing of tRNAs and rRNAs
-rRNAs are assembled into ribosomes in the nucleolus
-tRNAs are transcribed and processed in the nucleus and then sent to the cytoplasm to be linked to free amino acids for protein synthesis
-tRNAs use intramolecular hydrogen bonds, positioning the amino acid binding site at one end and the anicodon at the other end.

Ribosomes
-exist in cytoplasm in prokaryotes and the cytoplasm and rough ER in eukaryotes.
-mitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma.

tRNAs
-transcribed by DNA Pol III
-tRNA "Charging", each tRNA is linked to its correct amino acid by enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases

-A, P, and E sites during translation
