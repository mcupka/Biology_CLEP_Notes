1.6.2 DNA Replication

When DNA replicates, double-helix splits and each of the two strands of serves as a template for the new daughter strands.

Replication in Prokaryotes:

Many proteins and enzymes used in DNA replication.
-DNA Polymerase, enzyme that adds nucleotides to the growing strand of DNA. III used for DNA synthesis, I and II used for repair
-Helicase, enzyme that unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds that hold the base pairs together.
-RNA Primase, enzyme that synthesizes a short primer to get the DNA replication started, from there DNA Pol III can extend the strand

DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction.
-The leading strand is continuously synthesized after the primer is made.
-The lagging strand needs multiple primers for each of the short Okazaki fragments.
-DNA ligase seals gaps between fragments to create one continuous DNA strand 

Replication in Eukaryotes:

-Many more DNA Polymerases in Eurkaryotes than in Prokaryotes.
-Many more origins of replication in Eukaryotes than in Pro
-Replication much slower in Eukaryotes than in Pro

Telomeres, sections at the end of eukaryotic chromosomes that remain unpaird, may get shorter as the DNA is further replicated
-short sequence repeated many times at the end of the chromosones
-synthesis facilitated by DNA telomerase
-telomerase has a built-in RNA template that complements the last few nucleotides on the 3' end.
-telomeres on DNA shorten with age.

DNA Repair

-Errors in DNA synthesis are checked for by DNA Polymerase after adding each base
-If they aren't corrected then, they may be corrected afterward by a process called mismatch repair
-If they are never corrected, can lead to mutations or complications such as cancer.
-Also can be correctly by nucleotide excision repair, where the whole wrong segment is cut out and replaced


Mutations, variations of the nucleotide sequence of a genome
-Induced Mutations: caused by exposure to chemicals / UV rays / x-rays etc
-Spontaneous Mutations: caused by natural body reactions
-Silent Mutations: not expressed
-Point Mtations: affect a single base pair
	-Transition: purine or pyrimidine replaced with wrong purine or wrong pyrimidine
	-Transversion: purine replaced with pyrimide or vice versa
