1.6.3 Mutations

DNA Copied to mRNA, which is then used to synthesize amino acids, making proteins that control all of the major processes of the cell.

DNA directly copied to mRNA, 3 nucleotides correspond to 1 amino acid.
-two different nucleotide triplets can translate into the same amino acid. ie degenerative

Codon: a nucleotide triplet
-stop/nonsense codon: releases the polypeptide chain from the translation machinery
-start codon: AUG, sets the reading frame near the 5' end of mRNA

Mutations that only change one nucleotide can still synthesize the correct protein becuase of the degenerative nature of genetic code
