1.5.1 Structure of Chromosomes

Chromatin: Form DNA is found in before it's replicated. Unwound like a pile o f yarn
Chromosome: DNA wound up, right before mitosis. Wound around proteins called histones. Each group of histones w/ dna wound around is called a nucleosome.
Sister Chromatids: copies of each other, made before mitosis.
Centromere: visible constriction, holds chromatids together.
Homologous Chromosomes: have genes coding for the same characteristics, in the same location. Roughly same shape and size. Pair up before mitosis.
	-Alleles: Variations of the same gene, found on homologous chromosomes. Ex, in gene coding for hair color, one allele for black hair, another for blonde hair.
Ploidy: Denotes number of copies of genes / chromosomes in organism, abbreviated as a number and the letter "n" Ex
	-Haploid: 1n, having 1 copy of each gene
	-Diploid: 2n, having 2 copies of each gene
	-From moment of ferilization, humans are 2n, only sperm and eggs are haploid.
Karyotype: picture of chromosomes
	-For humans, 2n = 46 chromosomes
	-sex chromosomes are #23


Cell Division:

-Multicell organisms use cell division for growth and maintenence. Single cell organisms use it for reproduction.
-Cell Cycle: cycle from division of a parent cell through to the production of two daughter cells. Highly regulated.

-Genome: A cell's DNA, packaged a double-stranded DNA molecule
-Prokaryotes' genomes are a single, double-stranded DNA molecule in a loop or circle.
	-Contained in the nucleoid	-Some have smaller loops of DNA called plasmids that may be exchanged with other bacteria to give the bacteria new traits. ie antibiotic resistance
-Eukaryotes' genomes consist of several double-stranded DNA molecules.
	-Each species of eukaryotes has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells.
	-Humans have 46 Chromosomes, human gamets(sperm and eggs) have 23
	-diploid cells: 2n, 46 chromosomes in humans
	-haploid cells: 1n, 23 chromosomes in human gamets

-homologous chromosomes have same length and matching nucleotide segments called genes in the same location, or locus.
-Genes determine characteristics by coding for specific proteins.
-Traits are variations of those characteristics, ie bown, black, blonde are traits or the characteristic hair color.
-Each copy of a homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a different parent, therefore the genes themselves are not identical.

-Sex homologous pairs are the exception to the uniformity of homologous chromosomes. Genese found on x and y chromosomes are almost entirely different

-Chromosomes extremely tightly packed to fit into nucleus.
	-DNA wrapped around histone proteins to form nucleosome.
	-Then chromatin between nucleosomes coiled tightly
	-Then packed and organized by other proteins
