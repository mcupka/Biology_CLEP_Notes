3.4.1 Human Population Growth

Human populations grow by same means as other populations
-births - deaths = growth
-Complex, because we reason around resource limitations, technology, think about reproductive behavior

Human life span increased
-better nutrition and medicine
-infant mortality greatly decreased
-birth rate decreased due to contraception

Human Growth Rate Increased
-over 7 billion people in 2016
-Doubling time of population has decreased
-technology increased food production, but starvation happens due to inequal distribution

Demographic Transition: theory that proposes progressive demographic time periods of human population growth
1. At first, birth and death rates equal, population in equilibrium with environment
2. Societal developments of medicine and food production allow birth rate to overtake death rate. Population increases rapidly
3. Agrarian lifestyles (many children for labor) become less common, children are a liability in urban society
4. Medical advancement decreases infant mortality, urban populations increase rapidly
5. Industrialized countries have lower birh rates becuase they're using contraception
6. Increasing population strains environment, resources
