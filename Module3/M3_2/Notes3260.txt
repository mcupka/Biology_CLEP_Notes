3.2.6 Convergence, Extinction, Balanced Polymorphism, Genetic Drift

Convergence: unrelated species evolve similar characteristics due to similar environments
-ex long tonges of birds/beeds

Extinction: A species disappears from the planet forever
-Permian Extinction (250m years ago), lost 96% of species on the planet 

Polymorphism: genetic diversity within a species for a particular trait

Balanced Polymorphism: natural selection tends to keep number of forms stable; when one is scarce, its fitness increases

Genetic Drift: random change in allele frequency for a particular trait in a single population
-Ex storm randomly causes death of most squirrels carrying alleles for light coat color
