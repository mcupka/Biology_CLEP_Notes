3.2.7 Classification of Living Organisms

Taxonomy: organizes living things into groups based on appearance, genetics, evolutionary history

Binomial Nomenclature (Carolus Linnaeus): genus and species
-"Scientific name"
-ex Borrelia burgdorferi, homo sapien

Taxon: level of classification of living things
-Kingdom
-Phylum
-Class
-Order
-Family
-Genus
-Species

Domain: new concept, higher than kingdom
-3 domains: Archaea, Eubacteria, Eukaryota (Eukarya)
-Eukaryota is all eukaryotes, other two are prokaryotes

Eukaryote Kingdoms:
-Animalia, animals
-Plantae, plants
-Monera, fungi
-Protista, unicellular, animal-like or plant-like

Animal Phyla:
-Porifera, sponges
-Cnidaria, jellies
-Platyhelminthes, flatworms
-Nematoda, roundworms
-Mollusca, clams, snails, squid
-Annelida, earthworms
-Arthropoda, crabs, insects, spiders
-Echinodermata, starfish, sea urchins
-Chordata, fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians

Phylogenetic Trees: show evolutionary relationships

Related species may not necessarily look similar, although this is often the case.

Similary structure pointing to common ancestry = homologous
-More complex structes being similar points to common ancestry more than simple structures being similar

Molecular comparisons (DNA) also used to help determine ancestry

Clades / Monophyletic Groups = groups stemming from one single point. Must include ALL members of that group
