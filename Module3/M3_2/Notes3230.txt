3.2.3 Adaptive Radiation

Adaptation: inherited characteristic that provides a survival/reproduction advantage
-speed, camouflage, armour, hearing

Species: population of interbreeding individuals, common gene pool, viable offspring, don't breed with other populations
-a new species forms when two popoulations no longer interbreed

Resource Partitioning: decrease competition between species by utilizing more specialized niches
-Adaptive radion occurs as a result of resource partitioning
	-Alleles that allow individuals to use resources differently are adaptive
	-Over time, many new species evolve as a result of benefits of using new niches
-----------------------------------------------------------
Hybrid = cross between two species
-hybrid inviability: doesn't make it to full birth, dies in womb
-hybrid sterility: once born, is sterile, can never reproduce

Reconnection
-After speciation, two species may recombine 
-Hybrid zone:area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce
-if hybrids are less fit than parents, the speciation is reinforced and the species will continue to diverge until they can no longer mate
-if reproductive barriers weaken, the species may merge into one.

Only heritable traits can evolve
