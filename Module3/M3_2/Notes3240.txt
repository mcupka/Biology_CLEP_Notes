3.2.4 Major Features of Plant and Animal Evolution

Endosymbiont Theory: explains evolution of autotrophs from heterotrophs
-Early plants were aquatic, asexual
-Their movement to land was accompanied by adaptations for water storage, methods for dealing with increased gravitational pull

Plant Evolution
-Separate sexes allowed for greater genetic diversity
-First land plants didn't have seeds. Seeds allowed colonization of more / different habitats
-Evolution of flowers allowed animal attraction for pollination and seed dispersal

Animal Evolution
-First animals were aquatic, unicellular, soft-bodied
-Multicellularity and hard structures appeared (spicules, exoskeletons)
-Invertebrates were first on land
-Fish were the first animals with backbones
-Adaptations for conserving water and dealing with higher gravitational pull appeared with land colonization

Explosions
-Cambrian explosion: rapid increase in multicellular organisms
	-aquatic plants appeared
	-most major animal phyla appeared
	-new niches evident: active hunting, burrowing into sediment, making branching burrows, etc


The development of sexual reproduction increased the rate of evolution because it increases the chance of genetic recombination ie unique combination of traits that differs from the combinations of either parent. (diversity in genes)
