3.3.1 Stereotyped, Learned Social Behavior

Stereotyped Behavior: Instinctive, performed the same way by all individuals of a species, in response to a stimulus
-taxis: directional
-kinesis: speed change
-reflex: automatic movement of body part
-fixed action pattern: more complex series of behaviors

Fixed Action Pattern: Behavior sequence that continues, even when the stimulus is removed
-courtship behaviors
-feeding young
-circadian rhythms

Learned Behaviors: not instinctive, must be seen and practiced. Can be stopped mid-behavior. Based on life experience
-Conditioning
-Habituation
-Imprinting

Conditioning: Behavioral response to one stimulus is applied also to a different stimulus
-Dogs drool when they smell food
-Ring a bell when food is presented
-Dogs eventually drool both when they smell food and when they hear a the bell

Habituation: a response that decreases with exposure to a stimulus if no positive or negative result happens
-respnse decreases if the animal gets no response from it
-ex cat cries for attention. If you ignore the cat, so nothing good or bad comes of it, the cat eventually stops crying for attention

Imprinting: attachment to another animal or object during critical period (usally shortly after birth / hatching)
-crane hatchlings see a person right after hatching, instead of another crane. Hatchling imprints on person, following it to learn instead of the a crane

Innate vs Learned Behaviors

Innate Behaviors:
-movement and migration
	-kinesis, moving
	-taxis, more direct version of kinesis. directed movemnet toward or away from stimulus
	-migration: long-range seasonal movement of animals
-living in groups
	-signals, stimuli than annimals use to communicate with each other
	-aggressive displays, courtship displays, distraction displays

Altruistic behavior: lowers fitness of the individual behaving but increases the fitness of another individual.
-Protecting young
-Birds distracting predators from their nest


Intersexual selection: one sex chooses mates of the other
Intrasexual selection: competition for mates between species members of the same sex

Learned Behaviors:
-Habituation: getting used to a stimulus that doesn't produce a positive or negative result. No longer stimulated by it after some time.
-Imprinting
-Conditioned behavior: stimulus becomes associated with some response
	-Classical conditioning; Conditioned response becomes associated with conditioned stimulus. Unconditioned stimulus is orginal stimulus.Operant conditioning: positive or negative reinforcement forms conditioning
-Cognitive learning: manipulation of information using the mind; human learning via books etc.
