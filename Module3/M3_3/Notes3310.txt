3.3.1 Stereotyped, Learned Social Behavior

Stereotyped Behavior: Instinctive, performed the same way by all individuals of a species, in response to a stimulus
-taxis: directional
-kinesis: speed change
-reflex: automatic movement of body part
-fixed action pattern: more complex series of behaviors

Fixed Action Pattern: Behavior sequence that continues, even when the stimulus is removed
-courtship behaviors
-feeding young
-circadian rhythms

Learned Behaviors: not instinctive, must be seen and practiced. Can be stopped mid-behavior. Based on life experience
-Conditioning
-Habituation
-Imprinting

Conditioning: Behavioral response to one stimulus is applied also to a different stimulus
-Dogs drool when they smell food
-Ring a bell when food is presented
-Dogs eventually drool both when they smell food and when they hear a the bell
