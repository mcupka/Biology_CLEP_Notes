3.1.3 Population Growth and Regulation

Population Ecology:Study of groups of organisms of one species living together
-limiting factors
-birth rate
-death rate
-growth rate

Limiting Biotic Factors: Living things that limit a population size
-Dispersal: movement away from center
-Competition
-Predators
-Lack of prey/food
-Parasites

Limiting Abiotic Factors: non-living things that limit a population size
-Climate
-Landscape
-Soil
-Water Salinity
-Sunlight

Density: # of individuals per unit area
-Density increases, increases: competition, predation, disease

Demography: statistics like birth and death rate, age at maturity
-growth rate = birth rate - death rate


Exponential growth up to a limiting factor
-J curve
-Maximum population that an environment can support = Carying capacity
