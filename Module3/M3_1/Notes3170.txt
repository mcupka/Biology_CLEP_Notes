3.1.7 Island Biogeography

Biogeography: Study of distribution of organisms in space, historically & currently

Island Biogeography: Biogeography specific to islands and their species
-dispersal
-species diversity
	-area effects
	-distance effects
	-age effects

Dispersal: Species reach islands by dispersal methods
-flying
-blown by wind
-floating in water

Species Diversity = # of species on the island
-determined by:
	-immigration and extinction rates
	-size
	-distance to the mainland
	-age

Immigration: when a species arrives on an island
Extinction: whan a species disappears permanently from an island

As diversity increases, immigration rate decreases, and extinction rate increases
-Immigration rate decreases because the more species are present on an island, the less likely it is that a new individual coming to the island represents a new species
-Extinction rate increases because the more species are present on the island, the more competition there will be


Area Effects: larger islands have higher diversity than smaller islands
Distance Effects: diversity highest on islands nearest to the mainland
Age Effects: diversity highest on islands that are older
