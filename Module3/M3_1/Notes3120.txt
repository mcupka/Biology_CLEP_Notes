3.1.2 Biogeochemical Cycles

Biogeochemical cycles: circular movement of molecules through an ecosystem's living and nonliving things

The Water Cycle
-Precipitation: water falling to earth
-Evaporation: returns to the atmosphere
-Condensation: condenses from gas to a liquid form


The Carbon Cycle: carbon found in soil, atmosphere, and in water, fossils
-Returning Carbon Dioxide to atmosphere via human emissions (biggest source), evaporation in water
-Photosynthesis returns it, respiration returns it

The Nitrogen Cycle:
-majority of gas in atmosphere is nitrogen
-nitrogen sediments fall to ocean floor
-nitrogen is fixated by bacteria, removing it from the atmosphere
-other bacteria perform denitrification, returning it to hte atmosphere
-fertilizers and terrestrial organisms take it out of the atmosphere

Phosphorus Cycle: in rocks, terrestrial food webs, fertilizers. majority in rocks

Nitrogen is a major component of nucleic acids along with phospohorus

Coal forms when vegetation decays and is compacted via deep burial over millions of years
Long-term storage of carbon occurs when organisms are buried deep underground and fossilized
