3.1.4 Community Structure, Growth, Regulation

Community Ecology: Interactions among different species in the same area
-Competition
-Predation
-Symbiosis
-Succession


Competition: More than one species attempt to use the same limited resource
-Competative Exclusion Principle: no two species can occupy the same niche indefinitely; one will be the better competitor, the other go locally extinct
-Niche partitioning allows coexistence; ie a cactus uses surface water while a larger tree uses deeper water.

R-Selected Species: growth pattern = start very small and grow extremely rapidly, but die very quickly. Thrive in habitats that have frequent disturbances. They are the first ones to 'strike' reproducing very quickly after a disturbance

Keystone species: species upon which many other species in an ecosystem rely for survival, such that if removed the ecosystem would change drastically.
-disproportionate amount of influence for its size in an ecosystem

Foundation Species: species that dominates the ecosystem in both influence and abundance

Symbiosis: close interaction between two species
-Mutualism: both benefit
-Commensalism: one benefits, other neutral
-Parasitism: one benefits, other harmed

Succession: process through which community recovers from disturbance
-Primary: no soil (ex. lava flows, glacial moraine)
-Secondary: soil present (ex. abandoned fields)

Batesian Mimicry: harmless species mimics the look of a harmful one
Mullerian Mimicry: multiple species share same warning coloration, but they all actually have defenses
