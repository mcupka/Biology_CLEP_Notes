3.1.1 Energy Flow and Productivity in Ecosytems

Energy Flow / Food Cycle / Food Web
-Represents flow of energy (matter)
-Shows how energy enters and leaves

Trophic Levels
-Producers: make energy available to ecosystems via photosynthesis
-Consumers: Eat producers or other consumers

Primary Producer -> Primary Consumer -> Secondary Conumer -> Tertiary Consumer -> ... -> Apex Consumer

Trophic Categories
-Autotrophs: self-feeders, producers, make food molecules from the sun
-Heterotrophs: other feeders, consumers, get food molecules from eating others

Ecological Roles:
-Herbivores: eat plants
-Carnivores: eat animals
-Omnivores: eat both plants and animals

Transfer of energy from one trophic level to the next is very inefficient due to heat loss
-Each level gets 10% of the energy from the previous level

------------------------------

Chemautotrophs: usually bacteria in dark places, uses energy from chemical sources, not from the sun
Photoautotrophs: plants, algae, etc

Biomass: density of mass of things in a particular trophic level in an ecosystem per area

Gross primary productivity: the rate at which photosynthetic primary producers incorporate energy from the sun
Net primary productivity: the energy that remains in the primary producers after accounting for the organism's respiration and heat loss

Trophic Level Transfer Efficiency (TLTE) = (production of present trophic level) / (production of previous trophic level) * 100
-after multiple energy transfers, there is not enough energy left to support another trophic level
-Top trophic level = apex consumers


Biomagnification: harmful substances propogating through trophic levels
