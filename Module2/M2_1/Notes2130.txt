2.1.3 Food Translocation and Storage

Phloem: move sugars created by photosynthesis from leaves to the rest of the plant.

Sugars build up in phloem, water diffuses in from xylem, sugar solution pushed throughout the plant.

Some plants have special storage organs for storing carbohydrates (as starch).

---
Transportation of Photosynthates in the Phloem
-For newly developing plants, energy stored in polymers (like starch)
-Once leaves and shoots form, energy gained through photosynthesis
-Photosynthates: products of photosynthesis, usually in the form of simple sugars or sucrose.
-Translocation: source -> sink through phloem
