2.1.3 Food Translocation and Storage

Phloem: move sugars created by photosynthesis from leaves to the rest of the plant.



---
Transportation of Photosynthates in the Phloem
-For newly developing plants, energy stored in polymers (like starch)
-Once leaves and shoots form, energy gained through photosynthesis
-Photosynthates: products of photosynthesis, usually in the form of simple sugars or sucrose.
-Translocation: source -> sink through phloem
