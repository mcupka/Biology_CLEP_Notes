2.1.1 Root, Stem, Leaf, Flower, Seed, Fruit


Major Plant Organs: Shoots, Leaves, Flowers, Fruits, Roots
-Shoot: usually above ground, sometimes have leaves, flowers, fruits. Purpose to gather light and CO2 for photosynthesis
-Leaves: Gather light for photosynthesis. Sometimes modified or absent.
-Flowers: only present in angiosperms. Attract pollinators, release pollen.
-Fruits: Mature reproductive organs. Contain seeds, sometimes tasty flesh.
-Roots: Absorb water and nutrients from the soil. Below-ground. Sometimes store energy/water.

Auxin: hormone involved in regulating plant growth

The shoot system consists of two parts: the vegetative parts such as leaves and stems, and teh reproductive parts, such as flowers and fruits.

The root system supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals.

Permanent and nonpermanent (meristematic) tissues.
-Meristematic types based on location in the plant: Apical in tips of stems and roots. Lateral facilitate growth in thickness. Intercalary only in monocots, at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes (where leaves attach to a stem)
-Non-meristematic types: Dermal, covers and protects the plant. Vascular transports water, minerals, and sugars to different parts of the plant. Ground serves as a site for photosynthesis, provides support for vascular, and helps to store water and sugars.

Vascular tissue contains two different parts
-Xylem Cells: transport water and nutrients from roots elsewhere, dead.
-Phloem Cells: transport sugars and other organic compounds from photosynthetic tissue to the reast of the plant, living.

Monocot, one stem or leaf. Dicot, multiple.

Nodes: points of attachment for leaves
Internode: stem section between nodes
Petiole: part of stem that extends to base of the leaf
Apical Bud: in the tip of the shoot, contains apical meristem.

Stem Anatomy
-Parenchyma Cells: most common in plant cells, found in stem, root, leaf, and pulp of fruit. Responsible for metabolic funciton (photosynthesis) and they help repair and heal wounds.
-Collenchyma Cells: elongated cells with thick walls, provide structural support, found below the epidermis.
-Sclerenchyma Cells: also provide support, however many of them are dead at maturity.

Dermal Tissue
-Epidermis, layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue
-Bark, in woody plants, also protects plant.
-Epidermis in leaves contain stomata, through which gas is exchanged.
-Trichomes, on epidermal surface, reduce loss of water (transpiration), increase solar reflectance, and store compounds that protect from predators.

Vascular Tissue
-Tracheids: xylem cells with thick secondary walls through which water flows.
-Phloem tissue transport sugars, amino acids, and other organic compounds.

Ground Tissue
-pith closer to inner vascular tissue in a stem or root. cortex between vascular tissue and epidermis

Some species have modified stems that are suited for a particular habitat and environment.
-Rhizome, Corms, Stolons, Runners, Tubers, Bulbs, Thorns, Tendrils



Roots
-Anchor plants to soil, absorb water and minerals and transport them upwards, store products of photosynthesis.
-Dicots have tap root system, while monocots have a fibrous one
-Tap root system: main root that grows down vertically, from which many smaller lateral roots arise. Penetrates deep into soil.
-Fibrous root system: closer to soil surface, dense network of roots that helps prevent soil erosion
-Dry areas usually see deeper roots, while humid areas see shallow root systems.
-Roots have modifications like leaves that make them more fit for their environment. (Bulbs store startch, Aerial roots provide support above ground)


Leaves
-Main site for photosynthesis
-Adapt for environment. Ie smaller leaves in sunny areas to reduce water loss. Larger in rain forest to absorb more sunlight.
