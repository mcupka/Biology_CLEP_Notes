2.1.2 Water & Mineral Acquisition and Transport

Vascular Plants: have transport vessels for water, sugars, and minerals.
Non-vascular plants: no transport tissues. Small, inconspicuous.

Vascular Tissures: for transporting things, such as water and sugars
-Xylem, transports water and minerals.

Water and minerals diffuse into root cells
-Cohesion-tension pulls water and minerals up through plant as water vapor is lost out of the top of the plant.
-This works becuase of cohesive and adhesive properties of water.
