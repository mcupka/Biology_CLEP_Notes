2.1.2 Water & Mineral Acquisition and Transport

Vascular Plants: have transport vessels for water, sugars, and minerals.
Non-vascular plants: no transport tissues. Small, inconspicuous.

Vascular Tissures: for transporting things, such as water and sugars
-Xylem, transports water and minerals.

Water and minerals diffuse into root cells
-Cohesion-tension pulls water and minerals up through plant as water vapor is lost out of the top of the plant.
-This works becuase of cohesive and adhesive properties of water.

Phloem and Xylem are the main tissues responisble for transport of water, nutrients, and photosynthates.

Water Potential (Ψ): measure of potential energy in water
-It is the difference in potential energy between the given sample and pure water
-water moves from system with higher potential to the system of lower potential
-Plants can metabolically manipulate their water potential

Gibbs Free Energy: energy associated with a chemical reaction that can be used to do work (ΔΨ)

Transpiration: loss of water by evaportaion
-creates pressure deficit at the leaf surface, pulling water from the roots
-water held at night when transpiration stops
-transpiration regulated becuase it causes much water loss, plants choose between efficient photosynthesis and reduced water loss.
