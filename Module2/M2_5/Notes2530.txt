2.5.3 Linkage

The law of independent assortment isn't always true
-Some genes only on sex chromosomes
-Some genes always inherited together

Y-linked genes usually harmless becuase they're so small

X-linked genes responsible for several human genetic conditions ie color blindness, hemophilia, muscular dystrophy

Other linkage: some genes that are very close together may be inherited together because they are not split apart
