2.5.1 Mendelian Inheritance

Inheritance: characteristics passed from one generation to another, in forms of genes

Gregor Mendel: Austrian monk who studied pea plant inheritance ~ 1865
-First to quantify genetic tests
-His ideas still accurate for simple systems

Allele: alternate form of a gene. Everyone has 2 alleles for each gene, represented by a letter (R, r)

Homozygous: two copies of the same allele (RR or rr)

Heterozygous: one copy of each allele (Rr)

Dominant allele: always expressed when it's present. Shown by a capital letter (R, G, N)
Recessive allele: masked when dominant allele is present. Shown by lowercase letter (r, g, n)

Genotype: alleles carried by an individual
Phenotype: observable characteristics of an individual

Cross: sexual reproduction between different individuals

Character: a feature. ex hair color, plant height
Trait: Variation in physical appearance of a heritable characteristic
--------------------------------

Aa x Aa = 3:1 dominant phenotype (1 AA, 2 Aa, 1 aa)
AA x Aa = 4:0 dominant phonotype (2 AA, 2 Aa)
Aa x aa = 2:2 split in phenotype(2Aa, 2aa) 
AA x aa = 4:0 dominant (4 Aa)
aa x aa = 4:0 recessive (4 aa)
AA x AA = 4:0 dominant (4 AA)

Test Cross: Crossing a dominant phenotype with a homozygous recessive one to determine if the dominant is homozygous or heterozygous
-A? X aa to determine what ? is
-If any children express recessive, then it is heterozygous

Incomplete Dominance: When Aa expresses a blend of both A and a traits. (Red(AA) + White(aa) = Prink(Aa))
Codominance: Both traits expressed in Aa


X-Linked Traits: Men only have one x chromosome, so they will either be A, or a. Females have two, so they will be AA, aa, or Aa
-Male allele for x-linked comes only from the mother
-Female alleles for x-linked come 1 from mother and 1 from father

-If mother expresses the gene (aa) and father doesn't (A)
	-Male children will be (a) and express it
	-Female will be (Aa) and not express it

-If mother expresses the gene (aa) and father also does (a)
	-Male children will be (a) and express it
	-Female will be (aa) and also express it

-If mother doesn't express the gene but carries it (Aa) and father expresses it (a)
	-Male children will be (a) or (A) 50% chance to express or not
	-Female will be (Aa) or (aa) 50% change to express or not

-If mother doesn't express the gene but carries it (Aa) and father doesn't express it (A)
	-Male children will be (a) or (A) 50% chance to express or not
	-Female will be (AA) or (Aa) and not express it

-If mother doesn't express the gene and doesn't carry it (AA) and father doesn't express it (A)
	-Male children will be (A) not express it 
	-Female will be (AA) not express it

-If mother doesn't express the gene and doesn't carry it (AA) and father expresses it (a)
	-Male children will be (A) not express it 
	-Female will be (Aa) not express it
