2.5.1 Mendelian Inheritance

Inheritance: characteristics passed from one generation to another, in forms of genes

Gregor Mendel: Austrian monk who studied pea plant inheritance ~ 1865
-First to quantify genetic tests
-His ideas still accurate for simple systems

Allele: alternate form of a gene. Everyone has 2 alleles for each gene, represented by a letter (R, r)

Homozygous: two copies of the same allele (RR or rr)

Heterozygous: one copy of each allele (Rr)

Dominant allele: always expressed when it's present. Shown by a capital letter (R, G, N)
Recessive allele: masked when dominant allele is present. Shown by lowercase letter (r, g, n)

Genotype: alleles carried by an individual
Phenotype: observable characteristics of an individual

Cross: sexual reproduction between different individuals

Character: a feature. ex hair color, plant height
Trait: the genotype or phenotype of an individual for a given character
