2.4.6 Blood Circulation in the Human Embryo

Human embryos develop their own blood vessels
-Even though the embryo and mother exchange blood and other things

The embryo's blood vessels are next to the mother's and molecules are exchanged via diffusion:
-From mother to embryo: nutrients, water, oxygen
-From embryo to mother: carbon dioxide, waste
