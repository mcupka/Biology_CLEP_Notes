2.4.2 Clevage, Gastrulation, Germ Layers, Organ System Differentiation

All sexually reproding organisms start life as a zygote

Clevage: zygote divides several times without changing size

Developmental Stages:
1. Morula: Solid ball of cells 
2. Blastula: Hollow sphere of cells
3. Gastrula: Hollow sphere of cells with tube through center that forms digestive canal

Germ Layers: layers of the Gastrula 'hollow sphere' that exists around the digestive canal
1. Endotherm: Insinde, forms alimentary canal
2. Mesoderm: In the middle, forms muscle, bones, circulatory system, reproductive system
3. Ectoderm: Outside, forms skin, nervous system
--------------------------------------------------------

Gastrulation: The process by which the blastula folds on itself to form the germ layers, becoming the gastrula

Organogenesis: formation of organs from the gastrula
-Differentiation: embryonic cells express different genes, determining the types of cells that they will form into
-Neural tube formed which will give rise to brain and spine
