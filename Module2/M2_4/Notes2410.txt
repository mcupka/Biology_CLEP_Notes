2.4.1 Gamete Formation and Fertilization

Two processes involved in reproduction for multicellular organisms:
1. Gametogenesis
2. Fertilization

Gametogenesis: making gametes ie sperm and eggs
-Spermatogenesis: making sperm
	-Primary spermatocytes (2n) formed via mitosis
	-Secondary spermatocytes (1n) formed from primary via meiosis I
	-Sperm cells (1n) formed from secondary via meiosis II
	-occurs in spermatagonia, which are the cells in testes. Undergoes mitosis forming two cells: one primary spermatocyte and another cell that will give rise to the next generation
-Oogenesis: formation of eggs
	-occurs in oogonia, cells in ovaries
	-primary oocyte (2n) present in ovaries from birth
	-secondary oocyte (1n) formed from primary via meiosis I. Polar bond also formed.
	-Egg cells and polar bodies (1n) formed from secondary oocytes via meiosis II
	-Polar bodies recycled
-----------------------------------

Male reproductive system:
	-Scrotum: houses testicles and testes
	-Testes: organs that produce sperm and reproductive hormones
	-Sperm immobile at body temp, therefore the scrotum and pernis are external to the body, keeping them cooler
	-Seminal vescilces, prostate contribute to semen production

Female reproductive system:
	-Clitoris: stimulation
	-Labia: folds
	-Vestibular glands: secrete mucus
	-Ovaries: eggs development
	-Uterus: embryo development
	-Vagina: tube for birth / intercourse
