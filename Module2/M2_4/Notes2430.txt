2.4.3 Experimental Analysis of Vertebrate Development

Model Organisms: used by scientists to learn about generalities in vertebrate development
-easy to maintain in lab setting
-The majority of what we know about development has come from these models

Zebrafish is a model organism used to explore:
-effects of inhibitors on development
-effects of alcohol on development
-stages of development

Frog embryos another model organism used to investigate:
-Blastula formation
-Causes of Two-Headedness
-Control of Spinal Formation

Chicken embryos used to learn about:
-Formation of limbs
-Signaling molecules

Mouse embryos have helped us understand:
-Toe formation and separation
-cell fate determinants
