2.4.4 Extraembryonic Membranes

Extraembronic Membranes: membranes that develop around an embryo during development

Chorion: Regulates water, gasses, nutrients, wastes
-in egg-layers, it is in contact with inner shell surface
-in others, it is in contact with uterus

Amnion: Fluid filled sac around embryo
-used for cushioning
-temperature regulation

Allantois: comes from developing digestive tract, gas and nutrient exchange tissue
-Becomes umbilical cord in non-egg layer
-waste storage in egg-layers

Yolk Sac Membrane: comes from developing digestive tract also. Encloses yolk sac that stores nutrients
-becomes part of umbilical cord in non-egg layers
-larger in non-egg layer
