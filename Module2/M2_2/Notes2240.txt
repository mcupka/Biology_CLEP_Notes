2.2.4 Tropisms and Photoperiodicity

Tropism: any growth response that results in a plant growing toward or away from a particular stimulus

Phototropism, tropism response to light
-Some parts of the plant grow toward light (positive), some grow away from it (negative)
-Shoots grow toward, roots grow away

Gravitropism, response to gravity
-Roots display positive gravitropism
-Shoots display negative gravitropism
-Occurs as soon as seed germinates, organs begin to grow in appropriate direction no matter how the seed is oriented

Thigmotropism, response to touch
-Trees in windy habitats grow short and thick compared to same species elsewhere
-Plants that use objects for climbing (vines)
-Plants that close when touched
-Thigmonastic response = independent of direction of the touch ie venus fly trap.

Photoperiodicity: phsyiological response to relative lengths of night and day
-Some plants will only grow in a certain time of year; Some will only flower in certain times of year.

Phosphoperiodism: Use light to track time; Red light response
Phosphotropism: growing toward or away from light; Blue light response

Light reactions mediated by phtoreceptors which = a protein + a pigment called a chromophore

Amyoplasts, plastids involved in gravity response
