2.2.3 Plant Growth / Development: Hormonal Control

Plant Hormones
-Function similarly to animal hormones
-Transported in vascular system
-Control most aspects of growth and development
-Often several interact with each other

Auxins
-Promote shoot elongation
-Produced mostly in shoot tips
-Transported only from tip to base of the shoot

Cytokinins
-Stimulate cytokinesis
-Produced in actively growing tissure: roots, embryos, fruits

Gibberellins
-Affect cell division and elongation
-Fruit growth
-Seed germination
-Produced in young roots and leaves

Abscisic Acid
-Slows growth of plant tissues, antagonizing actions of growth hormones
-Ratio of ABA to growth hormones determines whether growth occurs

Ethylene
-Produced in fruit ripening
-Produced in response to stresses like drought, flood, etc
-Also produced as part of normal life cycle. ie fruit ripening and programmed cell death
----------

Plants control different hormones in response to stimuli
Short paragraphs in reading about each hormone
Flowering plants produce CO2. Most CO2 comes from environment but CO2 is also generated during cellular respiration of plants.
