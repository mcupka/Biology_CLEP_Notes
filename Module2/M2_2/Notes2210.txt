2.2.1 Alternation of generations in ferns, conifers, and flowering plants

The plant's lifecycle is an alternation of haploid and diploid phases.
-Both phases can undergo mitosis, usually only one goes through meiosis
-Sporophyte dominant in most plants, but depends on species

Sporophyte: diploid phase, produces spores through meiosis. Spores grow into gametophytes via mitosis
Gametophyte: haploid phase, produces gametes via mitosis, which fuse to form a new sporophyte which grows via mitosis. The cycle then begins again
--------

Gametophyte Stage
-prodece male and female gametes by mitosis.
-fusion of the male and female gametes form the diploid zygote, which develops into a sporophyte

Sporophyte Stage
-Once mature, produces spores via meiosis, which divide by mitosis to produce haploid gametophytes

Flowers contain plant reproductive structures, 4 main parts aka whorls
-Calyx: contains sepals, green, leafy structures that help protect the bud.
-Corolla: contains petals. together with the calyx is called the perianth
-Androecium: male sex structures
-Gynoecium: female sex structures
-Complete flowers contain all whorls, incomplete may not contain one of the androecium or gynoecium
