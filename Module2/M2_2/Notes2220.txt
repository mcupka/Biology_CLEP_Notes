2.2.2 Gamete Formation and Fertilization

Male gamete: sperm
Female gamete: egg
Zygote: fused sperm and egg (fertilized egg)
Embryo: gyrowing zygote (more than a few cells)

Plant sperm formed by male gametophyte
-Formed in large numbers
-Leave to join eggs
-Transmitting of sperm may 'swim' between wet areas, or packaged into pollen grains that float or are carried by animals.

Plant eggs formed by female gametophyte
-Produced in small numbers
-Larger than sperm
-Usually stay put. Sperm will come to it.

Fertilization similar to animals
-Female and male gametes fuse to form zygote
-In seed plants, sperm grows through plant tissue to reach the ovaries that have the eggs.
-In seedless plants, it's simpler

Angiosperms

Male gametophyte (The Pollen Grain)
-in male reproductive organs, development of pollen takes place in the microsporangium
-in the microsporanguim, the microspore mother cell divides by meiosis to create 4 microspores
-Each of the 4 will form a pollen grain
-Pollen grains have a tube cell through which the generative cell goes into the egg. While entering the egg the generative cell divides to form two sperms cells

Female gametophyte (The Embryo Sac)
-Megasporanguim, area where a single cell undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores
-One megaspore survives and undergoes mitosis to produce a female gametophyte, or embryo sac.
-Female gamete, egg cell, formed once a sperm fuses to the central cell.
-Synergids help guide the tube cell for fertilization of the egg, a zygote is formed
-Micropyle: opening for the tube to deliver the sperm through

Gymnosperms (No Flowers)
-Cones in coniferous trees. Male cones grow on lower, female on upper
-Takes a year for the tube to grow so that the sperm can fuse with the egg
-Female gametophyte exposed unlike in angiosperms
-Rely heavily on wind to pollinate

Pollination: in angiosperms, placement or transfer of pollen from anther -> stigma of same flower or another flower.
-In gynosperms, must transfer pollen from male cone to female cone.
-Upon fertilization, pollen germinates to form the pollen tube and the sperm.
-Self-pollination: same flower, or another flower on the same plant.
-Cross-pollination: Anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different plant of the same species.
