2.3.1 Major Animal Systems

*Apparently there are entire chapters in the book over these systems. The supplemental reading doesn't really cover them*

Body systems mostly controlled by hormones, but also affected by environment

Digestive system: processes ingested food and drink
Respiratory System: intake of essential gasses, and release of waste gasses
Circulatory System: Moves gasses, nutrients, hormones throughout the body
Musculoskeletal System: Provide suppport, stability, movement
Nervous System: passes messages from the brain to the rest of the body
Excretory System: Filters wastes and excess water from blood, releases outside body
Immune / Lymphatic System: Defense against invaders
-------------

Endothermic animals: fur, fat, feathers
Ectothermic animals: no insulation. dependent on environment

3 types of muscle tissue: smooth (or visceral), skeletal, and cardiac
-Skeletal muscle is the muscle that we voluntarily move
-Smooth / Visceral muscle is muscle of internal organs, lines trancts like digestive tract and blood vessels.
-Cardiac muscle is heart muscle and it very strong and mitochondia-dense so that it can be resistant to fatigue.

Autonomic Nervous System: part of nervous system that controls / regulates internal organs without conscious recognition or effort by the organism
-Sympathetic nervous system: Prepare organism for stress by increasing heart rate, blood flow to muscles, and decreasing blood flow to skin. Fight or flight response
-Parasympathetic nervous system: rest and digest. Conserves energy, slows heart, increases intestinal and gland activity, relaxes sphincter muscles in gastrointenstinal tract.
Sy


Urea produced when liver (or sometimes kidneys, or anywhere in body, but mostly in liver during digestion) breaks down amino acids (protein metabolism) and ammmonia through deamination
-Question at end of section: since the patient was not fed and proteins, only carbs and lipids, the urea must have come from breaking down of cellular proteins inside the patients body


Blood clotting: activation, adhesion, and aggregation of platelets to convert blood from liquid to gel form.

Some structures and functions:
-Alveolus: air sacs in lungs, allow for gas exchange
-Cilium: propelling cells, keeping airways clean, propeling sperm
-Sarcomere: in muscles, allow for contraction
-Neuron: electrically excitable cells, process and transmit information
-Nephron: in kidneys, separates water, ions, and small molecules from the blood. Filters blood of waster and toxins. Returns needed molecules to blood.

-----------------
Digestive System
-----------------

Oral cavity (mouth): entry point for food to the digestive system.
-Salivary amilase, enzyme that begins converting starches into a disaccharide called maltose
-Lipase, another enzyme that helps break down fats

Esophagus: connects mouth to stomach
Stomach: secretes gastric digestive juices
-pH in stomach between 1.5 and 2.5
Small intestine: completes digestion of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates
Large intestine: reabsorbes water from undigested food and processes the waste
Rectum and Anus
Accessory organs: secrte enzymes that aid in digestion
-Liver, Pancreas, Gallbladder

-----------------
Nervous System
-----------------

Made of neurons and glia.
-Neurons: send electrical and chemical signals
-Glia: non-neuronal cells in the nervous system that support neuronal development and signaling.

Neurons have charged membranes because there are different concentrations of ions inside and outside of the cell
Action potential: self-propagating mementary change in the electrical potential of a neuron (or muscle) membrane
Axon: tube-like structure that propagates a signla from a neuron's cell body to axon terminals
Synapse: junction between two neurons where neuronal signals are communicated

Cerebral Cortex: outermost sheet of brain tissue, involved in many higher order thinking functions
Amygdala: structure within the limbic system that processes fear
Temporal lobe: processes auditory input; also involved in speech, memory, and emotion processing

-----------------
Endorine System
-----------------

Controls body processes through production, secretion, and regulation of hormones. Ultimately working to maintain the body's homeostasis.

Lipid-derived hormones
-steroid hormones, ie estrogen and testosterone
-amino acid-derived hormones, epinepherine and norepinepherine. Thyroxide
-peptide hormones, polypeptide chain structure, oxytocin, growth hormone

Hormones bind to specific hormone receptors, only affecting the cells that posess the correct receptors

Pituitary: base of brain, growth, thyroid-stimulating hormones
Adrenal gland: at kidneys, osmoregulation
Thyroid: in the neck, metabolic rate. Need iodine
Pancreas: between stomach and small intestine, insulin for blood-sugar regulation, enzymes for digestion

Respiratory System

Circulatory System
-----------------------

Red blood cells: deliver oxygen to cells
-Hemoglobin, protein that carries oxygen (and CO2)
Plasma: liquid portion of blood

Heart muscle pumps blood through the circulatory system

---------------
Immune System
---------------
Pathogen: agents that cause disease
Macrophages recognize pathogens

Cell-mediated immune response: T-cells
Humoral immune response: controlled by B cells and antibodies.
