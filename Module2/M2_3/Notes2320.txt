2.3.2 Homeostasis

"Steady State"
-Temperature
-Ion Concentration
-Blood oxygen
-Blood glucose

Set Point: point at which an animal maintains a particular variable

Stimulus: fluctuations in a variable

Sensor: detects stimuli and sends signal to control center

Control center: generates output that triggers a physiological response to stimulus

Hormones: Chemicals used as signals, important for homeostsis

Homeostasis relies mostly on negative-feedback cycles, ie a stimulus results in an event that decreases the stimulus 

Ex. Human body temperature set point is 98.6 degrees F
-Exercise produces heat that raises your body temperature (stimulus)
-Nervous system (sensor) sends message to control center (brain)
-Brain causes body to sweat (response)
-Cooling from sweat decreases body temperature and sweating stops

Thermoregulation
-Endothermy: internal temperature regulation through heat generated by metabolism; ie mammals, birds
-Ectothermy: internal temperature regulated by external environment; ie amphibians, reptiles, fish, invertebrates
-----------

Brain instructs effector in response to a stimulus
Effector is a muscle that contracts, or a gland that secretes
Homeostasis controlled by nervous and endocrine systems

Negative feedback: stimulus causes the body to try and push variable back to normal
Positive feedback: stimulus causes the body to accelerate in the direction of the stimulus, pushing even further from normal

Pancreas: releases insulin or glucagon to regulate blood-sugar. Insulin make blood sugar decrease. Glucagon make blood sugar go up.

Parathyroid Gland: release parathyroid hormone (PTH), causing increase in calcium in the event that calcuim is low.

Positive feedback ex blood clotting, contractions during childbirth

Adjusting the set point:
-Ex blood pressure often high for a person then over time their set point will rise and the body will no longer recognize the high blood pressure as abnormal
-Acclimatization occurs when an animal changes body systems to adjust a set point. ie Dog's winter/summer coats or an animal at a higher altitude increasing the # of red blood cells to absorb more oxygen

Thermoregulation:
-As body temp rises, enzyme activity rises
-Proteins, including enzymes begin to denature at high heat
-Vasodilation increases blood flow to the body surface and cools the body, vasoconstriction reduces the flow and heats internal organs

Hypothalamus of the brain controls homeostasis
