2.3.3 Hormones in Homeostasis and Reproduction

Endocrine system regulates body to set points

Triggers: important physiological events. puberty, reproduction, etc

Endocrine system facilitates cell to cell communication ie glucose uptake, antihistamine release, etc

Hormones: Chemicals secreted by the endocrine system into the blood for transport
-Affects growth, metabolism, developemtn, homeostasis

Endocrine Gland: ductless gland or single cell that secretes a hormone, which travels through the blood

Hormones target the cells of organs that have receptors for that hormone

Hormones are signals.
-Once released by the control center, hormones work as signals in one of two ways:
	1. Diffuse into cells' cytoplasm and join with receptor protein, which causes a response
	2. Join with receptor protein in cell membrane, which causes a response

Hormones in Reproduction: hormones are responsible for sexual maturation and cycling, as well as lactation and other maternal behavior

*The reading was the same as the last section. I found the section on the hormones in the book though*

From the internet:
Parathyroid Gland: Control calcium levels
Thyroid Gland: Control metabolism mostly
Pancreas Gland: 2 glands in one, digestive stuff as well as hormones. Breaks down proteins, lipids, carbs, nucleic acids in digestion. Controls blood-glucose levels (blood sugar)
Adrenal Glands: On top of each kidney, helps regulate metabolism, immune system, blood pressure, response to stress, etc. Cortex and Medulla.
-Osmoregulation: control of water / salt levels in body, done by the removal of waste by adrenal glands
Thymus: controls T-Cell development ie immune response
